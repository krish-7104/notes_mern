This web app was created to revise my concepts of MERN and implement the latest best practices of React development. With a focus on user experience and efficiency, the app allows users to create, read, update, and delete notes, implementing full CRUD functionality. Also, use JWT to generate auth token and Bcrypt to encrypt the password.

The backend API was built using Node.js and Express.js, and the database was managed using MongoDB. The frontend was developed using React.js, with Redux used for state management. The combination of these technologies allowed for a seamless integration between the front and back ends, creating a fast and responsive web app.

This project serves as a great example of a full-stack MERN application and showcases the capabilities of each technology used. Excited to continue building and improving my React skills with more projects like this in the future!
